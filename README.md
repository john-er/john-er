<h1>Good to see you, I'm John Erinjery!</h1>

<h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
I am an aspiring BSc Physics major who's on the last lap of his entrance exam prep. Hence, I've been very busy for about an year, during which I had been unable to contribute.</br>
However, I'll be free in a few months, and can't wait to get back to those projects that I had really wanted to do!
</br>
<h3>Skillset</h3>

- Python
- Django
- CSS
- JS
- HTML
</br>

> Honestly, most of the projects I do are via Python, it really is my right handed language! I do plan to learn Kotlin a bit later, though.

I hope you find my projects useful!!
